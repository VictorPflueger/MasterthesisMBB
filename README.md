# Masterthesis_VictorPflueger_XAI-ChatGPT
The following content describes the programmed XAI Methods of Victor Martin PflÃ¼ger's master thesis on the topic: "Leveraging large language models for explainable artificial intelligence methods: Enhancing machine learning interpretability exemplified by ChatGPT".

## Environment and installation instructions
The following environment version was used by the author in the execution of the program code. These environment specifics must be used to ensure execution:

Operating System (OS): Windows 10 Pro, Version: 22H2, OS - Build: 9045.3448

Visual Studio Code - Version: 1.83.

Python 3.11.4 x64

Furthermore, in order to ensure the error free execution of the results of the master thesis, the libraries used by the author are specified in the requirements.txt - file.
These specifics must be adopted to ensure successful execution of the program code. 

## Branch
The code to be executed is stored in the "Main" branch. The code is publicly available under the following adress: https://github.com/VictorPflueger/MasterthesisMBB

## Code Execution
The files can be executed independently after one another in any order. It is recommended to read the README file and the requirements.txt in advance and apply the recommended installation specifics. 

To enable execution of the GPT call at the end of each file, the user must insert an OpenAI API key at position XXX:
openai.api_key = "XXX" --> openai.api_key = "sk-...3zzM" 

Such API keys can be generated at the following address, the use of these keys may generate costs for the user and should not be made available to the public: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

## Testing
All files were successfully executed before the master thesis was submitted. In case of non-functional execution or existing questions or problems with the code, the author can be contacted.
